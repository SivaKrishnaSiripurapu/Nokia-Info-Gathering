# Nokia-Info-Gathering
 Information-Gathering Report on the Nokia Website
 This repository contains a comprehensive information-gathering report on the Nokia website. It includes:
 Comprehensive Network Testing and Security Assessment
Here’s an enhanced breakdown of activities and tools used during the assessment, adhering strictly to ethical hacking principles:

🔹 Ping Testing

🛠️ Tool: Ping command

📌 Purpose: Verifies the reachability of a host and measures the round-trip time for messages sent.
🔹 NSLookup

🛠️ Tool: NSLookup command

📌 Purpose: Retrieves DNS records to analyze domain-to-IP mappings and validate configurations.
🔹 Traceroute

🛠️ Tool: Traceroute command (Linux/Windows)

📌 Purpose: Maps the route packets take to reach a target host, identifying potential network bottlenecks or misconfigurations.
🔹 Footprinting and Subdomain Enumeration

🛠️ Tools: Sublist3r, Amass

📌 Purpose:
📋 Enumerates subdomains for broader attack surface identification.
🌐 Helps discover potentially unprotected domains.

🔹 Port Scanning with Nmap

🛠️ Tool: Nmap (Network Mapper)

📌 Purpose:
🔎 Identifies open ports and services running on a target.
🚦 Discovers potential entry points for unauthorized access.

🧰 Additional Features:
OS detection.
Service versioning.
Firewall/IDS evasion.
🔹 Vulnerability Scanning with Nuclei

🛠️ Tool: Nuclei

📌 Purpose:
📂 Identifies known vulnerabilities using customizable YAML templates.
🔐 Pinpoints weaknesses in web applications, networks, and APIs.
🔹 Recommendations for Enhancing Security

✅ Harden the network perimeter: Deploy firewalls, IDS/IPS.

✅ Apply least privilege principles: Restrict access rights to critical systems.

✅ Patch management: Regularly update and patch operating systems, software, and applications.

✅ Use strong authentication mechanisms: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).

✅ Regular audits and monitoring: Employ SIEM tools for real-time monitoring.

✅ Employee training: Educate on cybersecurity awareness to mitigate social engineering attacks.

✨ Key Ethical Hacking Principles Followed:

📖 Legal and authorized testing only.

🤝 Client consent and collaboration.

🛡️ Focus on discovering vulnerabilities, not exploitation.
